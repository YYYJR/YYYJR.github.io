<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a third year undergraduate student from China University of Petroleum (East China). In 2022, I was selected to enter the Science Experimental Class of the College of Science. After major streaming, I am now studying Electronic Information (Experimental) Engineering in the College of Marine Space and Information.

My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
