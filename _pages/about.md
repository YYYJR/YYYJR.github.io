Hi,This is **Junru Yang(Êù®ÂêõËåπ)**.

I am a third year undergraduate student from China University of Petroleum (East China). In 2022, I was selected to enter the Science Experimental Class of the College of Science. After major streaming, I am now studying **Electronic Information (Experimental) Engineering** in the College of Marine Space and Information.

My major is electronic information, and my direction of interest is **integrated circuits, electronic packaging, and radar**.
