<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a third year undergraduate student from China University of Petroleum (East China). In 2022, I was selected to enter the Science Experimental Class of the College of Science. After major streaming, I am now studying Electronic Information (Experimental) Engineering in the College of Marine Space and Information.

My major is electronic information, and my direction of interest is hardware design, EDA design, and radar.
